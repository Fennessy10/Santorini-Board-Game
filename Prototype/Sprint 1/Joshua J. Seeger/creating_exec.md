## How to create the executable

### Execute the batch script I created (build.sh), which automatically runs the commands to compile the jar file from the source in the given dir.
### command to run: chmod +x build.sh (gives script exec perms)
### then simply type: ./build.sh from same directory the batch script is located

### afterwards use "java -jar prototype_test.jar" in order to run
